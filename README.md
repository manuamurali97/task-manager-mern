Task Manager – MERN Stack

A simple yet powerful task management web app built with the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) that lets you register, log in, and manage your tasks from anywhere.

I built this to demonstrate full-stack development skills, from backend API creation to frontend UI design — and to showcase secure authentication, CRUD functionality, and a responsive interface.

Features

User Authentication – Secure login & registration using JWT.

Task Management – Add, edit, delete, and mark tasks as completed or pending.

Protected API Routes – Only logged-in users can manage their tasks.

Responsive Design – Works on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

Modern UI – Built with React, styled for clean usability.
